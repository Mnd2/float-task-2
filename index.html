                Newton was an English physicist, mathematician, astronomer, natural philosopher, alchemist, 
                theologian and one of the most influential men in human history. His Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, 
                published in 1687, is considered to be the most influential book in the history of science.

                Einstein, a German physicist, is best known for his theory of relativity and specifically 
                mass-energy equivalence, expressed by the equation E = mc2. Einstein received the 1921 Nobel 
                Prize in Physics “for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law 
                of the photoelectric effect.

                <em> “The scientists of today think deeply instead of clearly. One must be sane to think clearly, 
                but one can think deeply and be quite insane.”<br><br></em>

                Tesla was a Serbian engineer and inventor who is often described as the most 
                important scientist and inventor of the modern age, a man who “shed light over the face of Earth”. 
                He is best known for many revolutionary contributions in the field of electricity and magnetism in the late 
                19th and early 20th centuries.
